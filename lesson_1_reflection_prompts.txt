How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

  it shows what are the changes we made in newer version, so its easy to figure out our error or typos.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    we can check what went wrong in newer version.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

  difference should not be too big  so that we can compare easily,and not too small for less cluttered.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

because some might file depend on another file

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log shows commit with message & id and git diff show changes between 2 commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

i can try new things and if something is broken, i can go back to previous versions & find bug easily.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    for web devlopement & projects.
